Day 03 of 2020 AoC: Ride the slide through hashy terrain with a twisted tobbogan

=== HowTo

Data is read from the file 'input03.txt' line by line to create a modulo terrain map (list of lists). 

Star1: How many trees are hit? Toboggan slides down 1 and 3 right. Check position modulo terrain tile width.

Star2: How many trees are hit? Toboggan errs along different paths. Multiply trees hit.
